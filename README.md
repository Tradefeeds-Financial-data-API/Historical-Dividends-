<a href="https://tradefeeds.com/historical-dividends-api/" rel="nofollow">Tradefeeds Historical Dividends API </a> provides historical prices data on dividend-paying stocks. By using our JSON REST API, you can keep informed about the amount and prices of historical dividends that companies pay to their shareholders. In Tradefeeds database, you can find regularly updated data on dividend payments and dividend calendar. For each company, the data updates occur either annually, semi-annually or quarterly depending on when the executive board announces and issues the dividend payments. If the corporate executives announce and issue annual dividend payments, this means that the data on dividend-paying stocks will be updated annually. 

The historical dividend data is available through JSON REST API or retrieved in downloadable excel or csv files. Tradefeeds Historical Dividend API is suitable for use by any type of customers - from developers who build their applications for a specific audience to in-house teams in all-sized companies. The data on historical dividends is highly demanded by financial analysts and investors who perform regular financial company analysis and valuation.
